## Time Series and ARIMA Modelling and Analysis of Rolls Royce ($RR) Share Data

**Project description:** In order to fit an ARIMA model that would aim to forecast the future share prices for Rolls Royce Holding PLC, previous monthly data must be collected. 50 data points were collected via Investing.com from the time period of March 2013 to April 2017. The closing value of the share on the first day of each month was used.

### 1. Identifying Which ARIMA Model To Utilise

Using MATLAB, an Autocorrelation Function and a Partial Autocorrelation Function for my collected $RR data was created. Using the rules of identifying ARIMA models, it could be seen that the ACF plot had positive autocorrelations out to a high number of lags and the PACF plot had a sharp lag at 1. This meant that a higer order of differencing would be used as per the ACF plot, and that this time series was an AR(1) time series, thus needing a (1,1,0) ARIMA model to forecast the data effectively.

### 2. Forecast Data With ARIMA Model

The resulting (1,1,0) ARIMA model produced a forecast which followed the general downwards trend of the time series with an upper and lower limit that took into account the fluctuation of the share price.

### 4. Conclusion

An ACF and PACF were then plotted using the residuals generated from the (1,1,0) ARIMA model in order to check the effectiveness of said model by identifying significant spikes on the ACF and PACF. Since there were no significant spikes on either of the plots, it can be concluded that model was effective at forecasting the future monthly values of Rolls Royce Holding PLC share prices, however, since the returned P-Value of ùëù = 0.537 is not significant, more experimenting could be done to find a model that is more optimal.
