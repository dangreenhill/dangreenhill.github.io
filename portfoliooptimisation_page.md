**Project description:** This dissertation was written to explore and analyse three methods of solving the Mean-Variance Markowitz portfolio optimization problem. The methods explored were quadratic programming, the eï¬ƒcient frontier and Monte Carlo simulations.
Fully functional codes were produced in MATLAB for each one of these methods and each one was critically evaluated on its strengths and weaknesses relative to the others.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
